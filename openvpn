Open Terminal (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T).
Install the OpenVPN client by entering:
 

    sudo apt-get install openvpn

    You may be asked to enter your user password to confirm your identity.
     

Navigate to the OpenVPN configuration directory with command:
 

    cd /etc/openvpn
     

Download OpenVPN configuration files with command
 

    sudo wget https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip

    In case you get ERROR: The certificate of `nordvpn.comâ€™ is not trusted., please install the ca-certificates package with command:
     
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
     

If you do not have the unzip package installed, download it by typing in
 

    sudo apt-get install unzip
     

Extract config.zip with command:
 

    sudo unzip ovpn.zip
     

Remove files that will no longer be used:
 

    sudo rm ovpn.zip



You're storing your authentication data in a file. The fact that OpenVPN is additional storing it in RAM is then something you shouldn't care about. It's there for environments where you type the password (or obtain it from some hardware security module). So just ignore the warning.

If you really want --auth-nocache, you can either:

    put it in your .ovpn file (as auth-nocache); or
    openvpn --auth-nocache --config lv2.nordvpn.com.udp1194.ovpn should work. The key thing is you need that --config argument to specify the config name.

The bad packet ID warning is telling you about something that happened on the network. Has nothing to do with caching (or not) authentication. If you want to get rid of this warning (after reading the sections about replay), use --mute-replay-warnings like it says (either on the command line or in the .ovpn file).
     

Enter the directory where the server configurations are. These folders are either ovpn_udp or ovpn_tcp:
 

    cd /etc/openvpn/ovpn_udp/
    cd /etc/openvpn/ovpn_tcp/
     

To see the list of all available servers, enter the following command:
 

    ls -al

Start OpenVPN with a chosen configuration by entering:
 

    sudo openvpn [file name]
    sudo openvpn us2957.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn
    sudo openvpn /etc/openvpn/ovpn_udp/us2957.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn
     

OpenVPN will ask you for credentials. Enter your NordVPN account login details.
You have successfully connected to VPN. To disconnect, open Terminal and press Ctrl + C on your keyboard.
